                    <p>A little over a week ago I read an interesting article that appeared on Hacker
News about <a href="http://searchengineland.com/tested-googlebot-crawls-JavaScript-heres-learned-220157">how the Googlebot crawls
JavaScript</a>,
which was quite informative and interesting although probably only to those who
write JavaScript powered websites/applications on a day-to-day basis - like me.</p>
<p>What I found even more interesting were some of the reactions on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9529782">Hacker
News comment thread</a>. I was quite
surprised (well, I am quite naive) to see some of the discussion contain some
anti-JavaScript sentiment. This is probably a good point to say that I am very
much pro-JavaScript and consider it a technology that has driven the web's
progression from static documents to interactive experiences (like google
maps).</p>
<p>I’m going to pick on someone now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMHO: Websites that don’t have “realtime” content should always stick with
traditional HTML. I’m a Webdeveloper myself and i don’t like the JavaScript
Frontend trend.</p>
<p>Many Devs use Frontend JS in places where it’s absolutely not needed. If
you’re building an App that updates in realtime, shows informations while
it’s created, i’m fine with Frontend JS, but it’s an overkill for most
content pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9530598">axx</a></p>
<p>When I read this it sort of blew my mind. How can a developer be against
client-side JavaScript for anything other than realtime content?! Clearly we
disagree.</p>
<p>JavaScript can be used to enhance almost any interaction that changes the state
of a “widget”. That goes for presenting more information, facilitating CRUD
actions, and creating rich media experiences such as visualisations. <em>It’s just
we’ve only recently started to get good at doing it quickly</em>.</p>
<h2>Crafting effective experiences with JavaScript</h2>
<p>Designing how we consume and interact with the web fundamentally changed when
AJAX became a thing. Click a button and watch something happen onscreen. Then
iPhone apps happened and they were doing it too… and better?! Ever since, the
web has looked slow by comparison and everyone points fingers at JavaScript for
being rubbish.</p>
<p>It’s a bit unfair though! We definitely can write performant JavaScript, it’s
just historically we haven’t. We could pontificate forever why that was, but
I’d rather put a few easy to implement ideas out there and get some discussion
going!</p>
<h3>Data first approach</h3>
<p>A lot of problematic JavaScript I’ve encountered in production suffered from
data bloat. The more data you need, the more data you have to wait for - that
bloat counts on page load, per frame, and on clean up. There’s a few common
things that come up when looking to optimise data and most can be dealt with
server side:</p>
<ol>
<li>GZIP data being sent</li>
<li>Remove unused properties from APIs where possible.</li>
<li>Move non-unique properties in repeated objects to a ‘summary’ type object.</li>
<li>If data is available on the server (and you know the client will need it
   immediately) send it inline with the page.</li>
<li>Defer loading of data not exposed to the user immediately to a subsequent
   API where possible.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Inline data</h4>
<p>Here’s a todo list component.</p>
<div class="full-width">
    <img src="../images/dist/no-longer-the-antihero/todo-list-wireframe.png" alt="Todo list wireframe" />
</div>

<p>Back in them olden days, we might have had the server render the markup and
then use JavaScript to extend it. But, it’s dynamic enough that reading/writing
from the DOM isn’t trivial. The features of this todo list include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating items</li>
<li>Reordering items</li>
<li>Editing items</li>
<li>Deleting items</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit of rendering the markup on the server that we don’t want to lose is
the data being on the page as soon as it loads. A lot of applications make the
mistake of serving an empty page very quickly and then fetching all the data
after the initial load. An alternative is to inline the data like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
    var todoItems = <span class="cp">[</span>
        <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="mi">14</span><span class="nx">a29154</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="nx">be5</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">45</span><span class="nx">e7</span><span class="na">-aa65</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">40585</span><span class="nx">f94cd85</span><span class="err">’</span>
            <span class="nb">value</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="nx">Make</span> <span class="nx">Espresso</span><span class="err">’</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="nb">done</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
        <span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="nx">da8ee3c9</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1701</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">4547</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="nx">dfe</span><span class="na">-b6c4ee4f4893</span><span class="err">’</span>
            <span class="nb">value</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="nx">x20</span> <span class="nx">intervals</span><span class="err">’</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="nb">done</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="cp">]</span>;
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>While we can’t display that data as soon as the page loads, we can display it
as soon as the JavaScript executes, which is pretty quick and can be optimised
for.</p>
<h4>Deferred Data</h4>
<p>Let’s add a feature to the todo example above which allows people to add notes
to a todo item. We could just extend our todoItems array that’s in the page:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
    var todoItems = <span class="cp">[</span>
        <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="mi">14</span><span class="nx">a29154</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="nx">be5</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">45</span><span class="nx">e7</span><span class="na">-aa65</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">40585</span><span class="nx">f94cd85</span><span class="err">’</span>
            <span class="nb">value</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="nx">Make</span> <span class="nx">Espresso</span><span class="err">’</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="nb">done</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
        <span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="nx">da8ee3c9</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1701</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">4547</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="nx">dfe</span><span class="na">-b6c4ee4f4893</span><span class="err">’</span>
            <span class="nb">value</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="nx">x20</span> <span class="nx">intervals</span><span class="err">’</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="nb">done</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="nx">note</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="nx">Meeting</span> <span class="nx">Brad</span> <span class="nx">at</span> <span class="nx">cemetery</span> <span class="nx">junction</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="err">’</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="cp">]</span>;
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But the todo list UI doesn’t allow users to see this detail until the interact
with the specific todo item. Not adding this property means less data to query
for, less data to send, and less data to load into memory.</p>
<p>The alternative is to create an API for getting further information or ‘detail’
on a particular todo item - something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">GET</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">api</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">todo</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">details</span><span class="o">/:</span><span class="n">id</span>

<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">note:</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="n">Meeting</span> <span class="n">Brad</span> <span class="n">at</span> <span class="n">cemetery</span> <span class="n">junction</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="err">’</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Obviously if this API is slow then the user experience will suffer. The data is
pretty small, so it’s TTFB (time to first byte) we should monitor and optimise
for on the server.</p>
<h3>Thinking in components</h3>
<p>The JavaScript in legacy websites and applications I encounter often looks
pretty similar:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s a lot of it</li>
<li>It’s grouped by “feature” if grouped at all</li>
<li>There’s a lot of duplicate/similar code</li>
<li>The vast majority of SLOC is focused around reading/writing from/to the DOM</li>
<li>It generally suffers from a lack of architecture and planned development</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not like all the previous maintainers of these websites were bad either -
they’re probably representative of the average front-end developer at the time.
It’s pretty obvious that frameworks can help solve most of these issues but
people still aren’t using them even when they have a fair amount of JavaScript
to maintain.</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons people shy away from frameworks is because they find
they restrict the speed they can roll out code at the beginning of a project.
You do have to architect the application you’re going to write if you want to
create a good codebase. But given the issues above, I think this is a
beneficial process.</p>
<p>JavaScript frameworks - well the good ones anyway - promote development in
terms of components rather than features. When you write a component to do one
job and it does it well, it can be used in multiple places. I like to think of
this as an application of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY
principle</a>, although I’m
not sure how accurate this is.</p>
<p>There’s something to be said for the added intricacy of component oriented
architecture. Components will likely consist of many sub-types working together
- like Angular’s directives and services. These tools must be used optimally
lest we end up with an application endlessly sprawling outwards with no code
re-use. Components allow for easy code reuse, but they also make it easier than
ever to just add another module without causing regression elsewhere.</p>
<p>Done right, a framework can solve issues 2 - 5 and maybe even issue #1 if your
framework coaches you to write expressive code; it’s no guarantee however.</p>
<h3>The DOM is a poor data storage tool</h3>
<p>It seems like we’ve used the DOM to store information and JavaScript to
manipulate the DOM forever. It made sense when JavaScript adoption was low,
search engines only indexed source HTML, and there were many accessibility
concerns - but none of these are true anymore! There are some clear
disadvantages to relying on the DOM for data storage.</p>
<ol>
<li>You have to write JavaScript every time you want to read/write from the DOM.
   That’s a lot of JavaScript.</li>
<li>Changes to the DOM have knock-on effects including repainting - the most
   costly aspect of runtime performance.</li>
<li>Some libraries <em>cough</em> jQuery <em>cough</em> are a bit opaque and make it easy to
   consecutively write/read to/from the DOM without the developer realising.</li>
<li>There may be many pieces of JavaScript modifying the DOM, so data you read
   has to be validated as well.</li>
<li>It’s very difficult to craft consistent behaviour around inconsistent data.
   It’s easy to introduce bugs into DOM driven applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recent frameworks have turned to templating for a solution which provides
flexible data binding for DOM behaviours. For most this is easier to maintain
and perhaps even to write performant code for.</p>
<h4>jQuery vs Angular</h4>
<p>When we bind events to elements in jQuery we’re working with the target element
unless we traverse the DOM for a wider scope, or bind the click to a parent
element and query the DOM for child elements. This means we have to attach the
data to the object we’re binding to, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">“delete”</span> <span class="na">data-id=</span><span class="s">“da8ee3c9-1701-4547-8dfe-b6c4ee4f4893”</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">“button”</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    Delete
<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>

    // Bind this function to every instance of ‘.delete’ on this page
$(‘.delete’).on(‘click’, function(e) {
            // Extract ID from target
    var todoId = $(e.target).data(‘id’);
    // Fn() that sends AJAX request to delete todoID
    deleteTodo(todoId);
});
</pre></div>


<p>With Angular we can work with repeated elements that have a wider scope and can
pass that scope around, no querying necessary.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">“todo-item”</span> <span class="na">data-ng-repeat=</span><span class="s">“todo</span> <span class="err">in</span> <span class="err">todoItems”</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">“delete”</span> <span class="na">data-ng-click=</span><span class="s">“delete(todo)”</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">“button”</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        Delete
    <span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There are some obvious benefits to this approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is less JavaScript to write/maintain because the framework handles the
  DOM mutation.</li>
<li>You get a clear understanding of how the component is glued together by just
  viewing the source HTML.</li>
<li>This follows DRY principles where we reference one object the application
  already knows about, rather than using new data read from the DOM.</li>
<li>It’s generally a much more expressive piece of code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A sense of maturity</h2>
<p>In a lot of ways it feels like this turn towards templating, frameworks that
enforce MVC or MVVM approaches - or <em>heck</em> just enforcing a pattern at all - is
a sign that Front-end development is growing up.</p>
<p>While we can still throw script on a page and have it work, we have the option
to use tools that help craft better code and experiences - though a little
discipline is required.</p>
